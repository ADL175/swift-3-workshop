##Lab-1  
###Constants and Variables  
> Use `let` to make a constant and `var` to make a variable.  
The value of a constant doesnâ€™t need to be known at compile time, but you must assign it a value exactly once.  
This means you can use constants to name a value that you determine once but use in many places.  

In `Swift3Workshop.playground`, on line `7`, under the `//Constants and Variables`. Type the following:  
```swift
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50
let myConstant = 4
myConstant = 10
```
